Lately, whenever I sit down in front of the computer, I can't help but remember those moments in Pokemon games where you accidentally try to use your bike inside of a building. "Oak's words echoed: There's a time and place for everything, but not now." was the game's response to this, making clear the limits of their universe. In my case, the words that echo my head aren't from any professor of sorts. The words that echo my head are, instead:  

**"You only live once - you should try to spend as much time on the computer as possible. After you die, you won't have access to it any more"** - *[@afraidofwasps on Twitter](https://twitter.com/afraidofwasps/status/1436082368264216576?lang=en)*  
  
Once this thought crosses my mind, I instantly feel like going out for a breath of fresh air, cleaning or reading a book instead. It's ironic how the thing that drives me out of Twitter is a one of the best tweets I have ever read.  

# Chronically online  
As a "chronically online" person, both on a literaly sense (I have been online since I has eight so... that's 2/3rds of my life), and on a figurative sense (the communities I take part in, the things I consume...), advertisements for Apple Vision Pro or Neuralink chips make me wince. The last thing I would want in this life is passing **more** connected. 

According to stadistics published by [The Independent](https://www.independent.co.uk/advisor/vpn/screen-time-statistics), human beings spend 6 hours and 37 minutes each day in front of screens. Taking out 8 hours for sleep, and another 8 ones for work / studying / chores / eating, we are left with barely an hour and a half a day of free time without screens. In other terms: we only make the most out of 18% of our free time. Somehow, our tech overlords want to extract more time out of our lives.  

I don't feel like it's unreasonable to say that attention economy is hitting it's limit: soon, there won't be any more free time to waste in social media. It won't be possible to make more money out of each user. And once the last minute of attention of the last user has been extracted, I hope that these platforms die forever, and that humanity will remember the attention economy as a dark age in our modern history.  
  
Until then, I will be echoing those words I talked about in my head, so that I can have a live that makes me truly happy.
