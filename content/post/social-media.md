Lately, you may have noticed a worrying trend in the internet: social media becoming less usable.  
There is a fairly simple explanation to this, but for that we have to understand what **social media is**.  
  
One may think social media is a place for, well, **socialization**. However, that is pretty wrong. The only thing you need to ask yourself is, **where does the money come from for this site?**.  
And the answer to that is always the same: advertisers. In that sense, social media is not a place for socialization, but merely a storefront where brands can remind you of their existence.   
When you understand this, everything makes sense: Twitter can succeed as long as they make it just unusable enough that you keep using it. Because **their profit isn't made from you enjoying the experience, but rather from you coming back to it.** And you don't need to enjoy something to keep going back, as any League of Legends player will tell you.  
Same goes for Reddit, who recently killed off all third party apps and most bots. Third party apps were an issue because they didn't show ads in the same way, and bots simply didn't make any profit for the company. It is not about costs, like they said, but rather about profits.

## Too big to fail?

The phrase "too big to fail" was widely to describe banks and financial institutions that were so big, that if they were to fail, the resulting fallout would impact the economy in disastrous ways.

Various economists have disputed that if this is truly the case, such institutions should have to be broken up into smaller ones.

It has also been used to describe the actual state of social media; it really feels like Instagram, Twitter and such are immune from punishment for any mistake they make, because well, they are simply too big.

However, I don't think that's the case. To understand it, we need to take a deeper look to the working model of social media.

## The attention model

Like I established before, social media merely functions as a storefront for brands. But obviously, there has to be some value provided so people keep looking at the storefront.

It is the same model that TV adopted. In the case of TV, the value you get is entertainment, news, documentaries... and in the case of social media, all you are getting is *user created content*.  

And that is why social media is genius as a money-making machine. It is the users that are both the producers and the product.  

However, this has an interesting side effect; **social media sites do not provide anything by themselves, except one thing: the bridge between production and consumption.** But what happens when that bridge is broken?  

In the case of Twitter, this is happening in real time. Elon Musk is taking out features from Twitter that make it easier to consume content from your friends rather than brands, and trying to shove advertising down users' throats. Every single of his decisions is motivated by this. Bots? They don't make money, so he killed them off. Not enough people using the for you page? Modify the algorithm, and redesign the app so people are forced to use it subconsciously. People don't care about brands? Prioritize paying users over normal users.  

Yet he is failing miserably at his purposes; in trying to make users consume more advertisements, he is merely reducing the value they get from the app and therefore the amount of consumption that happens.  

And that is why I'm fairly disillusioned in the Internet right now.   

## Communities  
The internet is an awesome place. It has brought the possibility to connect with people in your communities; your real life friends who are living far away, the people who like the same niche j-pop music as you, that love building bottle ships like you do, that still play the same arena shooter that you used to play back in the 90s...  

And that sense of community is part of the social phenomenon that the internet was during the early 2000's and up to the end of last decade.  
  
However, social media substituted forums, and in that process, **tried to monetize human connection.**

For that purpose, it invented algorithms whose only purpose is to keep you engaged at any cost. **Not engaged with your community, but with the storefront you are currently visiting.** And in that sense, social media makes community seem more distant than ever.  

You have probably already heard about how **algorithms are inciting political polarization due to recommending anger-inducing content and fake news to drive up engagement.**  
With social media using our emotions to keep us visiting, and pulling our communities away, it is no wonder we find it so amusing to *beat someone's ass in the QRTs.* But is that really what we want? Is that what we signed up for?  

These platforms make a profit by capitalizing on our attention through abusive practices, emotional manipulation and driving communities further apart. And they do so while profiting off the content we ourselves make. And they do so while seeming too big to fail. So what can we do?

## Taking agency back  
As established before, a social media is only as valuable as the content that users provide for free. So there is something that we can do. Simply, stop using them and find a platform that does not try to make us both the producers and the product.  
  
That platform used to be bulletin boards in the 90s. Then, it was forums. Then, I suppose it was early social media, before the advent of the algorithms.   

Now, I can only think of one such place: **the fediverse.**  

The fediverse is not a for-profit enterprise, so therefore it has no will to become a storefront.  It has no reason to incite hate between its users. And finally, it has no reason to reduce its users to a mere product.
