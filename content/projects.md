# Disclaimer
Most of these projects were written in 1 day or less.  
They are not quality code, nor represent the kind of things I can program.  
All of them are in need of very big rewrites to their codebase.  
They are, however, projects that I am fond of and enjoyed programming and therefore proud of :)
