These are a few projects that I have worked on for a while. They may still be buggy, but I am proud of them.

# Small projects

## Disclaimer

Most of these projects were written in 1 day or less, and are basically train-of-thought coding.  
They are not quality code, nor represent the kind of things I can program.  
All of them are in need of very big rewrites to their codebase.  
They are, however, projects that I am fond of and enjoyed programming and therefore proud of :)

## Uni Projects

These are projects made as assignments for several of my USAL courses. Some of them may need some polish, but were helpful development experiences:

- **[SSOOII-Batracios](https://github.com/Josde/SSOOII-Batracios)**: Process synchronization through IPC processes with UNIX libraries.
  - **[SSOII-Ranas](https://github.com/Josde/SSOOII-Ranas)**: Port of the previous project to Windows and WINAPI
- **[RedesI-NNTP](https://github.com/Josde/RedesI-NNTP)**: Implements a reduced version of the [Network News Transport Protocol](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_News_Transport_Protocol) in pure C sockets, allowing for users to share news and create bulletin boards.
- **[PIII-Musicfy](https://github.com/Josde/PIII-Musicfy)**: Music management library to learn about OOP and MVC in Java.
- **[IGU-CalorieTracker](https://github.com/Josde/IGU-CalorieTracker2)**: Calorie tracking software made to learn UI design and development in C# and WPF.
